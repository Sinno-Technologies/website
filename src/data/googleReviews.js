        body: "Jamil Sinno from Sinno Technologies Ltd. are one of the most patient, calm and easiest person to work with. Jamil created website for our cake shop. Simple, nothing fancy, just functional website was requested from him.Jamil created out website in no time and looks great, had not even one think to be changed on it. I wish if I met Jamil year ago but he is here now and I will for sure work with him longterm. Highly recommend Sinno Technologies to everyone. Deserves 10 stars from me."
